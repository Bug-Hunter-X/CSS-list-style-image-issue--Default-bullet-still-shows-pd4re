The following CSS code snippet is supposed to style a list with specific bullet points. However, it doesn't work as expected because of the missing `list-style-type` property.  The `list-style-image` property is defined but without a preceding `list-style-type: none;` to remove the default bullet, the image will appear beside and not replace the default bullet. 
```css
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-image: url('https://example.com/bullet.png');">
    Item 1
  </li>
  <li>
    Item 2
  </li>
</ul>
```
